# Wp-Contact-form-Ajax-plugin

the plugin creates a form with fields for name, email, phone number, and city, which can be displayed on any page or post using the shortcode [display_user_form]. The plugin also includes JavaScript code in a file called my-custom-scripts.js to handle an AJAX request to insert user data.

When a user submits the form, the plugin validates the input data and, if it passes validation, inserts it into a database table named 'khdata'. If the data is not valid, the plugin sends an error message back to the user.

The plugin is designed to collect and store contact information from users through a form on a WordPress website.
